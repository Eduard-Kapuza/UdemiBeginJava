/*
        Hello.
        My name is Edward, I am 24 years old.
        I was born in Belarus, in a small village.
        I grew up in an ordinary working class family.
        As a teenager, I did various part-time jobs.
        Due to which I had pocket money.
        I have younger brother and sister.
        Now I live and work in Minsk.
        I have a fiancee whom I love very much.
        At the moment I am working as an electromechanic at the Minsk-Sortirovochny station.
        I have been in this position for 4 years.
        Initially, he worked as an electrician for a year.
        Total work experience in this field is 5 years.
        As for education: I have graduated from 3 educational institutions.
        The first is the elementary school.
        I started my studies there in 2004 and graduated in 2013.
        While studying at school, he was fond of chess, swimming, football.
        The second is the railroad college.
        Entered in 2013.
        College education took 4 years.
        It was during this period that I first learned about Java.
        But unfortunately, the hobby turned out to be stronger than the desire to grow in this area.
        After graduating from college, I received a qualification - a technician in railway transport.
        After training, there was a break for six months, during which I worked in my specialty.
        In his free time, he was engaged in preparing for exams for further admission.
        Success was not long in coming.
        I successfully passed the entrance exams and entered the University of Transport.
        I was enrolled in the third year of distance learning.
        After 4 years in 2021, I graduated from this University.
        Received a degree in electrical engineering.
        In the same year, he took a course in driving a car.
        In January of this year, I learned about IT-OVERONE courses.
        And in February I started training.
        I chose Java.
        Why Java?
        It's simple, this language once interested me in something unknown.
        Once there were attempts to start studying it, but I never succeeded.
        And now I decided to fulfill that distant goal.
        I have been learning Java for almost 4 months now.
        During this time, a couple of projects were invented.
        Console game about war with monsters.
        Console emulation of the queue for the order and the issuance of orders in McDonald's.
        Words game.
        Now I am developing a site for the sale of mobile phones.
        I am working on the implementation of the website functionality using Java and Spring.
        In my spare time I study SQL and other technologies.
        I also study English.
        At the moment, the goal is to get a Java Developer position at Wargaming.
        I plan to achieve this goal by the end of this year.
        Then personal growth and life in a buzz.
